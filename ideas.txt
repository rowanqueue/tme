its the beginning of everything! rn there is nothing, and you have to... make everything

time (this lets things happen! things will only happen if time happens)
- natural: time passing generates more time
space (things will only happen if there is enough space for them)
- space is split into 4 dimensions! (1D,2D,3D,4D)
- natural: time -> space
mass (the idea of THINGS)
- objects now exist! They can... do things!
- natural: space -> mass (space folding in on itself)


YOUR JOB:
to make this universe faster than it would otherwise!
